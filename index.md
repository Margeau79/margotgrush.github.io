# About

I am a final year PhD candidate at Vienna University of Economics and Business, working under the supervision of Sylvia Frühwirth-Schnatter and Alfred Stiassny. I am also a quantitative analyst at Erste Group, responsible for macroeconometric modeling.  
My CV can be found here: [CV](CV.pdf)

## Miscellanea

I love music and have studied classical piano and vocals for some years. I have also attended several summer schools in jazz at the [Guildhall School of Music and Drama](https://www.gsmd.ac.uk) as well as had some amateur performances at various events.
